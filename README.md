OBS: Will be a great differential if you use the [Scss version of the bootstrap 4+](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/).

## Differentials

- Indented code is a pleasure to look at;
- Using [Bootstrap 4+ SCSS Version](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/theming/)
- Never use images wider than 1920px (unless this is really necessary or specified);
- You can use Pug to create static pages, but if you use React.js it will be a big differential;
- Effects and animations will receive bonus points;
- SVG Animations of shapes;
- WebGL Animations with Three.js or Babylon.js;
- Animations with Framer X;
- Sticky navigation bar (blue stripe on the middle) should be fixed on top after scrolling on page;
- Git is essential, but organization is also essential, remember this;
- Remember : [image compression](https://tinypng.com/) is important\!

This is a model of a sticky navigation-bar, fixed on top after scrolling on page.
